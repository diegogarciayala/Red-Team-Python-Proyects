Python Mini-Projects for Pentesters
Welcome to the Python Mini-Projects for Pentesters repository! This repository contains a series of Python projects tailored for penetration testing purposes.

Objective
The aim of this repository is to provide practical tools and scripts for various tasks related to ethical hacking and security testing. While I am responsible for programming each of these mini-projects, the ideas and objectives for these projects have been suggested by others. My role is to implement the functionality and deliver useful, well-structured tools.

About
This collection serves as an exploration of Python's capabilities in the field of penetration testing. As each project has been proposed externally, the diversity of challenges helps to ensure that the tools created are practical and applicable to real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and suggest improvements!
